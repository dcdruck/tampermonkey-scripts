# tampermonkey-scripts
This is a collection of Tampermonkey scripts that I have written for myself.

## Scripts

### kohlscharge-keyboard-nav-fix.js

Adds tabIndex properties to the username, password, and submit buttons on the My Kohls Charge login page, thus enabling proper keyboard navigation.

### ubisoft-store-age-gate-defeat.js

Attempts to detect the age gate form at the Ubisoft store (store.ubisoft.com) and populates it with a birth date of 1970-01-01.

### altpress-quiz-repair.js

My browser privacy settings and add-ons prevent the AltPress quizzes, hoster by Apester, from displaying normally inline. This script will detect those frames and replace them with a link to open the quiz in a new window instead.
